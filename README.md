My First Repository

Hello everyone, my name is Bryan and I am currently studying at the University of London. Currently a Year 1 student pursuing a Bachelors of Science in Data Science and Business Analytics. Am learning Python, SQL and Tableu on my own as it is not taught in school and I aspire to be proficient in all those softwares in the future! :)


This is my first time using Github and to be honest, I have no idea what I'm doing right now but that's okay.
Shall dedicate my heart and soul to learn how to use this and create something out what i have just learnt HAHA.
